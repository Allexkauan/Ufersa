# Description

# School supplies for remote access.

# And for clear and evaluative visualization of teachers.

# All projects are made in C language in Visual Studio Code IDE.

# To configure the Mingw compiler, it is necessary to download the compiler and install the basic C and C++ directories.

# After installing the compiler, its path needs to be defined in the PATH of the machine user, so the IDE knows where to send the compilation instructions.
